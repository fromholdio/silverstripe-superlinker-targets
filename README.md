# silverstripe-superlinker-targets

Use master/v2.x (compatible with SS 4 & 5).

This branch is under active development. It **will** change and break, likely including namespaces.

Has been basically superseded by Superlinker v3.x. This will be installable for existing sites, but for new sites it's recommended you simply implement any subclasses of Superlinker on a per-project basis, if even needed.
